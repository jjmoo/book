The liquid, Julian reflected, would trickle down inside the waistcoat and down, down into Reilly s trousers, so that even if the ice did not hurt his eye, the spots on his fly would be so embarrassing he would leave. And th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
things he would like to say. The yellow son of a bitch probably would pull out his handkerchief and try to laugh it off, or if he saw that no one else thought there was anything funny about it, he would give an imitation of a coldly indignant gentleman, a

was no one else in the car he felt a little ashamed, because he recognized that the chill was kid stuff; the way you feel when you have done something very good for somebody, or the way you feel about your mother. That was the way he felt about Ed Charney
.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  He felt loyal. \tab 
Recognizing this he wanted to do something to show how loyal he could be, and the nearest thing at hand that gave him any chance to do something for Ed was the champagne. He turned to see that the champagne was still covered with blankets

In a short time the sedan did o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

dhouses, and Al made it his business to know who went to the roadhouses. A lot of wise guys in Gibbsville thought they were getting away with murder by taking their girl friends to the country hotels in the Pennsylvania Dutch part of the county. The wise 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 Hagemann just got up and shut the door and when Ed left they were the best of friends and still were. Ed even arranged it that Hagemann could get away with cheating on the one with glasses. Oh, in this business you had to look for all the angles. \tab 
Al Gre\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
co stepped on it to keep up with English, who now had the accelerator down to the floor, and was keeping it there. You could tell that that was what he was doing, because when the wheels of the sedan got out of the tracks the car would leap up to the side
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
of the road, slapping the long pile of snow. Al noticed that Mrs. English, who had her fur collar turned up higher than her ears, did not turn on English. That meant she was mad. Any woman ordinarily would be sitting up on the seat and bawling her husband
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 out. But if he was any judge, Al was sure she was not saying a word. He began to wonder about this English dame. \tab

ng, namely, that if you had a hunch about a person, a real hunch that kept bothering you, something usually happened to prove that your hunch was either dead wrong or dead right. \tab 
It was seven miles and just a little over from the country club to the Gibb\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ville Bank & Trust Building, and practically all of the last three miles was a new and nearly straight stretch of road, which had been easier to clear; it was protected from winds by a railroad embankment on one side. Al Grecco had to step on it some more
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
when English hit the stretch, because English was letting it out for all the sedan would take. Al kept his mind on the driving now. He did not want to get too close to English, and make English sore; but he did not want to lose him; he wanted to be close 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
y if English got into trouble. But English was all right. One of those guys that can drive when they re drunk or sober, the only difference being that when they re drunk they have no consideration for what they might be doing to the car. \tab 
When the two car\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 reached Gibbsville Al Grecco made up his mind that he would best please Ed Charney by following English all the way home, so he turned up Lantenengo Street after the sedan. He followed about a block behind the sedan, all the way out Lantenengo Street to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
wentieth Street. The Englishes had their house on Twin Oaks Road, but you could see all of Twin Oaks Road from Twentieth and Lantenengo. Al stopped. English had shifted into second for the uphill grade and the snow of Twentieth Street. He made the turn al
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 right, and in a few seconds he stopped in front of the house. The lights of the car went out, and then the porch light went on, and Al could see Mrs. English on the porch, opening the door, the light on in one of the rooms of the downstairs floor. Then E

Al Grecco put his car in reverse and backed int\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
utside. Gibbsville, the whole world, was resting after the snow. He heard a sound that could mean only one thing; one of the Harley kids next door had a new Flexible Flyer for Christmas, and was trying it out belly-bumpers down the Harley driveway, which 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 as separated from the English driveway only by a two-foot hedge. It would not take long for the room to get warm, so he decided to lie in bed for a few minutes. \tab 
There ought to be more days like this, he thought. Slowly, without turning his head, he pulle\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 himself up to a half sitting position and reached out for the package of Lucky Strikes on the table between his bed and Caroline s bed. Then he remembered to know better than to look in the direction of Caroline s bed and looked. He was right again: Caro
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ine had not slept in her bed. Everything returned to him then, as though in a terrible, vibrating sound; like standing too near a big bell and having it suddenly struck without warning. His fingers and his mouth lit a cigarette; they knew how. He was not 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hinking of a cigarette, for with the ringing of that bell came the hangover feeling and the remorse. It took him a little while, but eventually he remembered the worst thing he had done, and it was plenty bad. He remembered throwing a drink at Harry Reill
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 , throwing it in his fat, cheap, gross Irish face. So now it was Christmas and peace on earth. \tab 
He got out of bed, not caring to wait for warmth and luxury. His feet hit the cold hardwood floor and he stuck his toes in bedroom slippers and made for the ba\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hroom. He had felt physically worse many times, but this was a pretty good hangover. It is a pretty good hangover when you look at yourself in the mirror and can see nothing above the bridge of your nose. You do not see your eyes, nor the condition of you
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

As he passed the living-room he saw a piled row of packages, obviously gifts, on the table in th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Apollo was a hotel and restaurant. There had been a hotel on the site of the Apollo for close to a century, but the Pennsylvania Dutch family who had the restaurant before George Poppas took it over had not kept the hotel part open. Then when George Poppa
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, who actually was wearing those white Greek kilts when he arrived in Gibbsville, began to make money on the restaurant, someone mentioned that the building had been a hotel for nearly a hundred years, and George spent a lot of money on making the place a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hotel again. The rooms were small and had a fireproof look about them, with steel beds and other furniture. The hotel was clean, the rooms were small and cheap, and the Apollo got a big play from salesmen who had their swindle sheets to think of. The John
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Gibb Hotel, Gibbsville s big inn, was expensive. \tab 
Al Grecco was one of the few permanent guests of the Apollo. He had a room there, for which he paid nothing. Ed Charney had some kind of arrangement with George Poppas, in which no money changed hands. Ed \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
anted Al to be at the Apollo to receive messages and so on. Whenever there were strangers from other mobs in town on business, or friends who just happened to be passing through Gibbsville, they always looked up Ed Charney at the Apollo. And if Ed was not
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 there, he wanted someone to be on hand, and that someone usually was Al Grecco. \tab 
Al had his hat on but was carrying his dark blue overcoat. There was not a customer in the place. Smitty, who was a taxi driver and two-bit pimp, was sitting at the marble co\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

Loving Cup was behind the counter, and seemed to be the only waiter in the place. Loving Cup was about twenty, perhaps less; slight, with a bad complexion and a terrible breat\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
. The boys were always kidding Loving Cup about his ears, from which he got his name. They were at least a third as long as his whole head, and stuck out. Also, the boys often had kidded Loving Cup about his lonely sex life, until one night for a gag they
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
took him to the Dew Drop and paid for his entertainment. But when he came downstairs Mimi said to them: Well, you wise guys, this kid got more than any of you. Howdia like that? He s the only man in the crowd. And Loving Cup listened delightedly, his eyes
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
bright and gleaming and wicked and small. From that night on the boys made no cracks about Loving Cup and his lonely sex life. They still referred to him as Loving Cup, and called him Bertha, but they had some respect for him. \tab

 and weighed about 130 pounds with his suit on. He had been with Ed Charney and eating regularly for four years, but he still did not gain much weight. Stayed about the same. His bones were small, and he was a thin little man in every part of him. He was

orn in Gibbsville, the son of Italian parents. His father worked on a navvy gang and supported six children, of whom Al was the third. Al s name was not Al, and it was not Grecco. His real name was Anthony Joseph Murascho, or Tony Murascho, until he was e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 several other times: once when a false alarm was turned in (he had an honest alibi) ; once for attempted rape (the girl could not positively identify more than two of the six suspects); once for breaking the seals on a freight car (the railroad detective
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 listened to his father s plea, and they had a good case against four other boys, so out of kindness to the old man they did not prosecute Tony); once for stabbing a colleague in a poolroom argument (no one, not even the victim, could swear Tony had done

It was when he was eighteen, the same year of his life that he went to the county jail, that he got the name of Al Grecco. At that time he decided to be a prizefighter, and though he had a lingering touch of gon\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rrhea, he went into training and studied the sweet science under Packy McGovern, Gibbsville s leading and only fight promoter. Packy told him he was a born fighter, had the real fighting heart, and that the clap was no worse than a bad cold. He made Tony 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ay off women, alcohol, and cigarettes, and do a lot of bag-punching. He showed Tony how to hold his elbows and how to keep his right foot in position so he could move his body backward without taking a backward step; that was footwork. He taught Tony how

o scrape an opponent s eyes with the palm of the glove, and also how to use his thumb, and also how to butt. He of course instructed Tony never to enter a ring without first knocking a few dents into the aluminum-cup supporter which is supposed to be a pr

tection against foul blows. You never know when you can claim foul and get away with it, and if the cup is not dented no club physician would dare allow the claim. Tony Murascho, who up to that time had been known only as a tough little guinny, was matche
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  to fight a preliminary bout at McGovern s Hall. \tab 
As it happened, Lydia Faunce Browne was assigned to write a feature story about that fight card. Lydia Faunce Browne was not a Gibbsville girl originally. She came from Columbus, Ohio, and had been in Gibb\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ville five years when her husband deserted her. He was younger than Mrs. Browne, who at the time of the desertion was forty-nine, and he left behind, besides Lydia, a large bill at the Lantenengo Country Club, another big bill at the Gibbsville Club, and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
everal other bills. For a time Mrs. Browne eked out a living and paid a little on the bills by teaching auction bridge to the wives of the Jewish storekeepers, but she finally flattered Bob Hooker, editor of the Standard, into giving her a job on the staf
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

I went to the boxing match, and to be completely frank and honest, I enjoyed myself. What is this t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
boo that man-made convention has placed upon women going to boxing matches? Can it be that men are just a little selfish, depriving women of the fun and beauty of the boxing match? And 1 use the word beauty advisedly, after long and careful consideration.
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 For there was beauty in McGovern s Hall last night. Let me tell you about it. \tab 
To you women who cannot attend boxing matches because of the aforementioned masculine taboo that has been placed on attendance at the fights by women, permit me a few words of \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
xplanation. The principal contest of the evening, like all good things, is called the wind-up and it comes last. It follows the introductory bouts which are known as preliminaries or prelims I believe they were called by my friend Mr. Doug Campbell, popul
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r sports editor of the Standard, who escorted me to McGovern s Hall and showed me the ropes. In the prelims one sees the lesser known lights of the boxing fraternity, and it is considered a kind of obscurity to be relegated to the prelims. But it was in a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 prelim that I saw real beauty. \tab A mere strip of a lad, hardly more than a boy he was, and his name is Tony Morascho. Doug Campbell informed me that it was the d}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24

ut of Tony Morascho but I sincerely trust it will not be Tony s last, for there was beauty personified, grace in every ripple of his lithe young frame, symmetry and rhythm and the speed of a cobra as it strikes the helpless rabbit. Beauty! Do you know El 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Grecco, the celebrated Spanish artist? Surely you do. Well, there was El Grecco, to the life. & \tab That was how Al Grecco got his name. \tab 
He could not live the name down. The gang at the poolroom and at the gym called him El Grecco, and for a gag Packy McGov\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rn billed him as Al Grecco on the next card. The name followed him into prison was, in fact, waiting for him there; Lantenengo County Prison was ruled by a warden who, though no deep student of penology, believed in permitting his wards to have newspapers
,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 cigarettes, whiskey, assignations, cards anything, so long as they paid for it. And so when Al Grecco was sent up on the poorbox burglary matter he was not altogether unknown at the Stoney Lonesome, as the prison was called. \tab 
When Al had served his time \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e came out with some idea of turning square. He wanted to turn square, because he had seen so many ex-convicts in the movies who came out with one of two plans: either you turned square, or you got even with the person who got you sent up. He could not ge
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 even with Father Burns, the curate who had caught him burgling the poorbox, because it was a sacrilege to hit a priest, and anyhow Father Burns had been transferred to another parish. And so Al decided to turn square. First, though, there were two things
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
he wanted to do. There was no one to give him money while he was in prison, and he felt he had been deprived of the two most important things you can have. He had about ten dollars, his earnings in prison, but that was not enough for a big night. He wante
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 twenty. So he got in a game of pool, to get his eye and his stroke back, and surprised himself by being pretty good. That gave him confidence, and be asked if he could take a cue in a money game. He lost all his money in the game and Joe Steinmetz, the c

ippled man who owned the place, would not stake him. Steinmetz would give him a job, he said, but no money to shoot pool with. So Al walked out of the place, wishing he had insulted Joe. Outside the poolroom, which was the next building to the Apollo hote

For three years he worked for Joe Steinmetz, more or less regularly. \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 N\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
o one could beat him shooting straight pool, and he had great skill and luck in Nine Ball, Ouch, Harrigan, One Ball in the side and other gambling pool games. He saw Ed Charney a couple of times a week, and Ed called him Al. Ed seldom played pool, because
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
there were only six tables in the place, and though he could have had any table by asking for it or even hinting that he wanted to play, he did not take advantage of his power. When he played he played with Snake Eyes O Neill, the wisecracking, happy-go-l

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Snake was always singing or humming. He never knew the words of a song until after it was old, and he used to make sounds, Neeyaa, to to to tata, tee to tee, laddie deetle, instead of singing the words. He was not called Snake Eyes because he had eyes lik

 a snake. Far from it. The name was a trapshooting term. He had big brown eyes that were always smiling. O Neill was tall and skinny and in Al s opinion was the snappiest dresser he ever had seen. Al counted up one time and he figured O Neill had at least
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
fourteen suits of clothes, all the latest cut from Broadway, New York City. Ed Charney was not a very snappy dresser. Ed had quite a few suits, but he did not change them much. His pants often needed pressing, and he often put his hat on so that the bow o

ANYONE in Gibbsville who had any important money made it in coal; anthracite. Gibbsville people, when they went away, always had trouble explaining \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
where they lived. They would say: I live in the coal regions, and people would say, Oh, yes, near Pittsburgh. Then Gibbsvillians would have to go into detail. People outside of Pennsylvania do not know that there is all the difference in the world between
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the two kinds of coal, and in the conditions under which anthracite and bituminous are mined. The anthracite region lies roughly between Scranton on the north and Gibbsville on the south. In fact Point Mountain, upon which Gibbsville s earliest settlement
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 was made, is the delight of geologists, who come from as far away as Germany to examine Gibbsville \tab 
Conglomerate, a stone formation found nowhere else in the world. When that geological squeeze, or whatever it was that produced veins of coal, occurred, it\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
did not go south of Point Mountain, and coal is found on the north slope of Point Mountain, but not on the south side, and at the eastern face of Point Mountain is found Gibbsville Conglomerate. The richest veins of anthracite in the world are within a th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rty-mile sector from Gibbsville, and when those veins are being worked, Gibbsville prospers. When the mines are idle, Gibbsville puts on a long face and begins to think in terms of soup kitchens. \tab 
The anthracite region, unlike the bituminous, is a strong \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
old of union labor. The United Mine Workers of America is the strongest single force in the anthracite region, and under it the anthracite miner lives a civilized life compared with that of the miner in the soft coal regions about Pittsburgh, West Virgini
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, and the western states. The coal and iron police in the anthracite region have been so unimportant since the unionization of the mines that they seldom are mentioned. A candidate for governor of Pennsylvania cannot be elected without the support of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 U\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
.M.W.A., and the Pennsylvania State Police never are called black cossacks in the anthracite region. A candidate for any political office in the anthracite counties would not think of having anything printed without getting the typesetters union label on 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
is cards and billboards. The union is responsible for the Pennsylvania mining laws, which are the best in the world (although not yet the best there could be), and labor conditions, so far as labor strife was concerned, were all right in 1930, and had bee
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 all right since the disastrous strike of 1925. At that time the union called a strike which lasted 110 days, the longest strike in anthracite history. There was no violence beyond the small squabble, and there was no starvation among the miners. But anth
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
acite markets disappeared. Domestic sales were hurt permanently; the oil burner was installed in thousands of homes. Anthracite is practically smokeless, and was satisfactory to home owners, but they could not get anthracite during the strike, and when th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 oil burner was installed there was no point in going back to coal. And so, as a result of the 1925 strike, the anthracite industry went back to work without nearly the demand for the product that there had been when the strike was called 110 days before.
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
There had been another long strike in 1922, and the two strikes taught consumers that the industry was not dependable. The feeling was that any time the union felt like it, it would call a strike, shutting off the supply of anthracite. \tab 
Thus what were boo\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 times for the rest of the country were something less for Gibbsville. The year of Our Lord 1929 saw many of the mines near Gibbsville working on a three-day-a-week basis. The blasts of the giant whistles at the collieries, more powerful than those of any
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 steamship, were not heard rolling down the valleys as they had been before the 1925 strike, every morning at five and six o clock. The anthracite industry was just about licked. \tab 
Still there were a great many people in Gibbsville who had money in 1930. Th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 very rich, who always had money, still had a lot of money. And the merchants and bankers, doctors and lawyers and dentists who had money to play the market continued to spend their principal. Mr. Hoover was an engineer, and in a mining country engineers 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
re respected. Gibbsville men and women who were in the market trusted that cold fat pinched face as they had trusted the cold thin pinched face of Mr. Coolidge, and in 1930 the good day s work of October 29, 1929, continued to be known as a strong technic

ollar. His income from private practice was about $10,000, and this totaled up to more than he could spend in a year, without being foolish. In addition to that his wife, Elizabeth McHenry English, had an income which in 1930 was about $6,000. In other ye

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
out; the Swedes had been massacred by the Leni Lenape Indians, and the Swedish name of the original settlement has been lost). Old Adam English, as Dr. English called him, who certainly would have been old if he had lived till 1930, was a Philadelphian. I

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

They went over there. Jean was Caroline s best friend, and Froggy was one of the group whom Julian regarded as his best friends. He had no single best friend, had had none since college. His best friend in college was with the Standard Oil in China
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, and he never heard from him except about once a year. With these people Julian felt safe and at ease. Froggy, thirty-four, was not quite five years older than Julian. Froggy had lost an arm in the war, and probably because of that Julian felt less close
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
to him than to the other men of the same age who had been in France. Julian s war record had been made in college, as a member of the S.A.T.C., and he still had the feeling that he should have enlisted to fight and not to go to college. Year by year the f

Tonight s dinner, as almost every guest was able to tell at a glance, was the club s two-fifty dinner. This was a club dinner dance, and all members were invited. At a dinner such as the Ammermann s, the hostess coul\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d

 arrange with the steward for the dollar-fifty (roast chicken), the two-dollar (roast turkey), or the two-fifty (filet mignon), and this had been the filet mignon dinner. The Ammermanns had just that much money, and their position in Gibbsville was just t

at certain and insecure, that they had to give the best of everything. Conforming to custom, the Ammermanns did not supply drinks, nor did they pay the dance subscriptions. A man on accepting an invitation to the dinner was paired off with a woman or girl
.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 The custom for unmarried, unengaged men was to accept the dinner invitation with his card, and then to telephone the hostess and ask if she wanted him to escort someone to the dinner. All this was arranged beforehand, much more subtly than might be suppo

misunderstand when you gave her what amounted to a rush. Sometimes, of course, Mill and \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the girls like her would get a real rush by a man who had drunk more than usual. Whatever was cruel about the system, there were some things to be said for it; for one thing, by the time a girl was twenty-five she usually was prepared, knew precisely what
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
to expect, of every dance that she went to. Only a very few girls of Mill s type went to a dance with sadly foolish hopes that this dance would be different from any other. And there was one other unwritten, unspoken agreement among the dancing men: if a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 G\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ibbsville girl of doubtful popularity inveigled an out-of-town man to come to a club dance, the Gibbsville men did go a little bit out of their way to see that she made a good showing. They danced with her twice instead of once in a night; with the result
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
that all but the saddest of the sad birds married themselves off to out-of-town men. Of course when they once married their ugly duckling days were forgiven and forgotten; such girls took their places with the most popular girls. But it had to be marriage
,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  not merely an engagement, but the man could be the worst heel, stupid, badly dressed-anything, so long as he was not a Jew. Not that any Gibbsville girl of the country club-Lantenengo Street set ever married a Jew. She }{

have dared. \tab By the time a \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
man reached junior year in college he knew how he was situated in the country club social life. Julian, for instance, had known for years that what had happened tonight would always happen: that he would sit at table between one attractive girl and one sa
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 bird. Always the attractive men, or those who were accepted as attractive in Gibbsville, were given a sad bird as a duty and an attractive girl as a reward. The attractive girls far outnumbered the sad birds. On Julian s right sat Jean Ogden; on his left
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 was Constance Walker, who danced as though her sex life depended on it. Constance was a distant cousin of Caroline s. \tab 
All during dinner Julian s thoughts kept returning to Caroline. Constance, prolonging what had long since ceased to be a slightly amusin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 tradition, always called Julian, Cousin Julian, or plain Cousin. He danced once with Constance between courses, and he found himself incredulous all over again at her physical resemblance to Caroline. The two girls were almost exactly the same height and
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
weight, and there was no denying that Constance had a lovely figure. Yes, she had it a little on Caroline, or at least he thought she had; she was fresher than Caroline to him. He knew that under a bright light the small of Caroline s back showed an unmis
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 akable patch of down. He knew where the cicatrix of Caroline s vaccination stood out on her left thigh; but though he had seen Constance many times in a bathing suit, he }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid9389186 \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 wasn\loch\af0\dbch\af31505\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid5379393\charrsid4136512 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 sure that she had been vaccinated at all. He was thinking of this as he danced \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
with Constance, and he was on the verge of asking her whether she was vaccinated when he became aware that he was holding her tight and she was holding him just as tight, and for good reason. He felt ashamed of himself and sorry for Constance. It was a di
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ty trick to get this kid excited. It was a low trick to be excited himself. He slowly relaxed his hold. \tab 
But the process of comparing the girl he was dancing with, eating with, with the girl he had married, who was her cousin, gave him something to enjoy \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
n secret. Whenever he was on a party and did not drink too much he needed a secret game to play or a mental task to perform the while he apparently was observing the amenities. Caroline was thirty-one and Constance was still in college and probably about 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
en years younger than Caroline. The cousins were pretty good types of their respective colleges: Caroline had gone to Bryn Mawr, Constance was at Smith the plain girl who goes to Smith and competes with the smart Jewesses for Phi Beta Kappa, as distinguis
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ed from the pretty girls who go to Smith and write to Yale. Caroline was the perfect small-town girl at Bryn Mawr; from private school in her home town, to a good prep school, to Bryn Mawr and the Bryn Mawr manner, which means quick maturity and an everla
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ting tendency to enthusiasms. Constance knew everything, but Caroline still was finding things out-the capital of South Dakota, the identity of Mike Pingatore, the location of Dalhousie, the handicap system in polo, the ingredients of a Side Car. He wonde
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ed why he put so much stress on the education of the two girls, and then he stumbled upon a truth: that Caroline was an educated girl whose education was behind her and for all time would be part of her background, whereas with Constance and girls like he
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 oh, what difference did it make? Constance was an unimportant little girl. But he was glad he discovered that about Caroline and her education. It was worth remembering, and as happened so often when he made a discovery about her, he wanted to tell Carol
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ne about it, to try it out on her and see if she agreed with it. He knew what she would say. She would say and it would be the truth that she had been telling him practically that for years. 
\tab The dinner guests stood up and he looked for Caroline. He saw s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e was too far away to have it worth making a point of going to her. That turned out to be an error in judgment. \tab 
When the Ammermann dinner party rose, that did not mean all the people eating in the dining room rose too. The Ammermann party was the largest\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
and therefore the most important, but there were many smaller parties of varying size and degrees of importance. One of these was a squat little dinner given by Mrs. Gorman, Harry Reilly s sister. There were eight at her table: two Irish Catholic doctors 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nd their wives; Monsignor Creedon, pastor of the Church of SS. Peter & Paul; and Mr. and Mrs. J. Frank Kirkpatrick, the Philadelphia criminal lawyer and his wife. They were having the two-fifty dinner, and champagne from a bucket under the table, in more 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
r less open defiance of Sec. 7, Rule XI, House Rules & Regulations, Lantenengo Country Club. Mrs. Gorman always went to the big dances at the club, and always she was the hostess at a small dinner, like tonight s. Her guests all took each other for grante
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 after the first awkward politeness. They ate in silence and at the coffee, which was served at the table, the men would sit back and burn their cigars, and the men and women would watch, completely un-self-consciously, the gay folk at the largest dinner 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
arty. They would watch without staring except Monsignor Creedon, who would sit with his hands folded somewhat ecclesiastically on the table in front of him, sometimes folding the tinfoil of his cigar, sometimes telling a story in a softly musical voice an
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 a beautifully modulated brogue. He knew everyone in Gibbsville, and he was a member of the club, but he belonged to the club for the golf, and in the dining-room he never spoke to anyone unless he was first spoken to. It was a spurious display of dignity
,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 but it had the right effect on his non-Catholic acquaintances, as well as on his parishioners. He had been made old and philosophical before his time, because Church politics had deprived him, his parish, and Gibbsville of the bishopric they all had been
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
trying for years to get. The Cardinal hated his guts, everyone said, and fought against making SS. Peter & Paul s a cathedral and Father Creedon a bishop. Instead he was elevated to the monsignori, made rural dean and irremovable rector of SS. Peter & Pau
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 s and thereby tacitly informed that he was to discontinue all activity tending to make a cathedral out of SS. Peter & Paul s. It was a sad blow for him as well as for the rich laymen of his parish, who loved Creedon, and for the more powerful Masons in t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e Coal & Iron Company, who respected this man whom they never could understand. I m a strong Presbyterian, they would say, but let me tell you, nobody says anything against Father Creedon in my hearing and gets away with it, Catholic or no Catholic.

\par \tab \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 There\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 were those among his parishioners who secretly resented Monsignor Creedon s serving on non-sectarian committees in community activities, but this sort of criticism could be traced to disgruntled Knights of Columbus. The Coal & Iron was ruled by the Mason
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, who admired Monsignor Creedon, and who tolerated the Knights of Columbus. The latter felt that their pastor ought to use his influence more frequently in advancing Knights. He never did. He used his influence in coaxing better company houses for the min
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rs families out of the directorate; or in wangling contributions for poorer parishes than his own. The U.M.W.A. organizers and field workers hated Monsignor Creedon because he was so close to the bigwigs of the company. \tab 
On the other hand, he did sometime\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 use his influence to help a Protestant. He got them bail, helped them get jobs. He had bought a Cadillac from Julian, instead of a Lincoln from the Ford dealer, who was a Catholic. He bought three Fords for his curates to atone for patronizing Julian s b
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
siness. Three years ago he had driven his car, a Buick, to Julian s garage and went in Julian s office and said: Good morning, son. Do you have any nice black Cadillac sedans today? He bought a car right off the floor and paid cash for it. His curates car
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  went to the Ford dealer for repairs and service, but he always bought his tires and other needs at Julian s garage. \tab 
Julian wanted to go to the bathroom after the dinner party stood up, and on his way to the men s locker room he had to pass Mrs. Gorman s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
table. He looked at Mrs. Gorman and she did not speak to him, but that was not unusual. But he felt the chill that passed between him and the men at the table. Kirkpatrick nodded politically and showed his teeth, but the doctors frankly snubbed him, and M
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
nsignor Creedon, whose round, bluish face usually smiled sadly above that purple thing he wore under his Roman collar, nodded just once and did not smile. It took Julian a few seconds to figure it out, because in his dealings with Catholics he so often fo
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
got to consider the Catholic point of view. But by the time he was alone in the men s room he had it figured out: they all regarded his insulting Harry Reilly as an insult to themselves. There was no other reason why he should throw a drink at Reilly, so 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
t must be because he was an unattractive Irish Catholic whom he could insult freely. He did not believe they were quite right. But one thing he knew; if the Catholics had declared war on him, he was in a tough spot. In the Smith-Hoover campaign two men, o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e a jeweler and the other a lime and cement dealer, had let it be known that they were members of the Ku Klux Klan and were outspokenly against Smith because he was a Catholic. Those two were the only Gibbsville business men who had come out in the open. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nd now both of them were bankrupt. \tab 
Drying his hands Julian thought it might be a good idea to sound out Monsignor Creedon, and he sat down to wait for the priest to come back to the locker-room. He pushed the button and told William, the locker-room wait\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r, to get a bottle of Scotch out of his locker and put it with two glasses and ice and clubsoda on a small table near the locker. He poured himself a mild drink and lit a cigarette. \tab 
Men and boys wandered in, making cracks about his being exclusive. Bobby\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Herrmann came in and before he could say anything Julian told him to keep his trap shut. One or two of the younger kids showed by the expression of their faces when they saw the extra empty glass and the bottle of Scotch that they thought Julian was being
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ignored. It was pretty funny. They wanted to be nice, he could see, and they wanted to have a drink, but their wanting to be nice and their wanting a drink were not enough to make them associate with an outcast. What the hell had he done? he wondered. He

as if Harry Reilly were a popularity contest winner or something. If most people told the truth they would agree that R\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
eilly was a terrible person, a climber, a nouveau riche even in Gibbsville where fifty thousand dollars was a sizable fortune. Julian thought back over some other terrible things, really terrible things, that people had done in the club without being made
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
to feel they had committed sacrilege. There was the time Bobby Herrmann or Whit Hofman or Froggy Ogden no one knew which wanted to test a carboy of alcohol which Whit had bought. One of the three (they all were very drunk at the time) touched a match to t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e alcohol to see if it was genuine, and a table, chairs, a bench, and part of a row of lockers were ruined or destroyed before the fire was extinguished. There was the time a member of a visiting golf team was swinging a mashie in the locker-room and Joe

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
? Hardly. He still visited the club and got drunk with the boys. There was the time Ed Klitsch wandered stark naked upstairs to the steward s living quarters and presented himself, ready for action, to the steward s wife. That was remembered as a good jok
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
. There were innumerable vomitings, more or less disastrous. There was the hair-pulling, face-scratching episode between Kitty Hofman and Mary Lou Diefenderfer, after Kitty heard that Mary Lou had said Kitty ought to be suppressed by the vice squad. There
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

The Gibbsville Mission was an old, three-story brick house in the very dingiest part of Gibbsville, and was supported by Lantenengo Street contributions. Babies were brought there to b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

One afternoon in the spring of 1926 Caroline had said good-by to the children and had gone around, tried doors, getting ready to close the Mission for the day. She was putting on her hat, standing in fr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o

Her great fear for days after that was that his grimy hands had given her a venereal disease. He never came back to the Mission, and she resigned the next week, but for weeks she was sure she had syphilis or something. The incident fin

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
was free to marry and have babies, that there was nothing wrong with her. When she insisted on paying him he charged her fifteen dollars. This money he gave, without Caroline s knowledge, to be sure, to the mother of the redhead, on the theory that the mo

That was Caroline s first completely unpleasant encounter with the male sex. She thought of it constantly in the days that followed. When \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
permanent effect of that afternoon at the Mission, as she referred to it in her frequent introspection, was that her ignorance of sex was pointed up. She knew herself for a completely inexperienced girl, and for the first time she began to remember the ca
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e histories in Havelock Ellis and Krafft-Ebing and the lesser psychologists as more than merely pornography. \tab 
Up to that summer Caroline had been deeply in love twice in her life, although from the time she put her hair up she was always in love with some\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

This lasted a minute, two minutes, maybe five, before she squeezed back into herself and put her head on his shoulder. She was ashamed and gr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 live within two or three squares of the children of parents who are not rich, not even by Gibbsville standards. This makes for a spurious democracy, especially among boys, which may or may not be better than no democracy at all. In any case, in order to

et a ball game going the sons of the Gibbsville rich had to play with the sons of the non-rich. There were not even nine, let alone eighteen, boys of Julian s age among the rich, and so the rich boys could not even have their own team. Consequently, from

he time he was out of kindergarten until he was ready to go away to prep school, Julian s friends were not all from Lantenengo Street. Carter Davis would stop for him, or he would stop for Carter, when they were going to play baseball or football. They wo

ld go down the hill to Christiana Street, the next street, and join the gang. The gang s members had for fathers a butcher, a motorman, a practical surveyor (that is, a surveyor who had not gone to college), a freight clerk, two bookkeepers for the coal c

mpany, a Baptist minister, a neighborhood saloonkeeper, a mechanic in a garage (which he called a garridge), and a perennial convict (who was up this time for stealing 100,000 cigarettes from the Gibbsville Tobacco Company). \tab 
These boys had enough to eat.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
They did not have to sell papers, although the minister s son sold subscriptions to The Saturday Evening Post and was always talking about blue vouchers or green vouchers and the Ranger bike he was going to get when he had enough vouchers. He was not avai

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 helped to make him unpopular in the gang. You could always tell his voice from the others: it was high, and his enunciation was not sing-songy like the other boys , which showed strong Pennsylvania Dutch influence. Julian liked him least of all. Best of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ll he liked Walt Davis, the son of the cigarette thief. Walt was no relation to Carter. Walt was cross-eyed, which somehow made him handsome, or Julian thought so. In the nights preceding Hallowe en it was Walt who remembered the various Nights: one night
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
was Gate Night, when you took people s gates off the fences; another night was Tick-Tack Night, when you held a button through which string had been run and wound up, against window panes, making a very effective sound until the string ran down: another n

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
. If they didn t, you stuck a pin in the doorbell and threw the doormat out in the street and carried away the porch furniture and poured buckets of water on the porch so it would freeze in the night. Walt knew which Night was which; he got the informatio

The leader of the gang was Butch Doerflinger. He was fat and strong and brave. He had killed more copperheads than anyone else and was a better swimmer than anyone else and knew all about older people because he had watched his father a

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 horse. \tab 
There were things not to talk about in the gang: you did not talk about jail, because of Walt s father; nor about drunken men, because there was a saloonkeeper s son; nor about the Catholics, because the motorman s son and one bookkeeper s son wer

 Catholic. Julian also was not allowed to mention the name of any doctor. These things did come up and were discussed pretty thoroughly, but usually in the absence of the boy whom the talk would embarrass. There was enough to talk about: girls; changes in
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 boys which occurred at fourteen; parades; which would you rather have; if you had a million dollars what would you do; what were you going to be when \tab

igarettes to be smoked: Ziras, Sweet Caps, Piedmonts, Hassans. Julian sometimes bought Condax cigarettes, which were more expensive. Butch and Julian were the heavy smokers of the gang, but Julian liked the smell of someone else s cigarette better than he

at Gibbsville Junction they would get on and ride four miles to Alton or the five miles to Swedish Haven. It was a cold and dangerous ride, and about once a year some boy would fall off and lose a leg or be killed under the wheels, but the practice of hop
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ing Goalies went on. It was not wise to go beyond Swedish Haven, because after that the railroad veered off too far from the highway. There was a Goalie that slowed down at Gibbsville Junction every day at about three-fifteen, and it reached Swedish Haven
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
at four o clock, which usually gave the gang time enough to get home, either by bumming rides on the grocery wagons or stealing rides on the trolley cars, or walking. You could get home only moderately late for supper. \tab 
There was one other game that Julia\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 did not like, because he was afraid of the consequences. That was known simply as Five-Finger Grab. There were two five-and-ten stores, Woolworth s and Kresge s, in Gibbsville, and about once a month after school the gang would wander through the stores.
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
Sometimes they would not take a thing, usually because they were watched carefully by the clerks and the manager, whose office was placed so that he could look down on every counter. But sometimes after a tour of the store the gang would meet, and two or 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hree of the boys would say: Look what I got, and show what they had got in the Five-Finger Grab: pencils, magnifying glasses, screw drivers, pliers, spools of wire, nickel Rocket baseballs, hard candy, school tablets, toys, cotton gloves, friction tape th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
se were some of the things that would be produced by the proud five-finger grabbers. The other boys would be ashamed, and the next time they went to the store everyone would try to get something. \tab 
Julian at first would refuse to participate in the Five-Fi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ger Grab, but when Carter Davis abandoned his side and went over to the grabbers, Julian had to do something. Once he tried to buy something a jar of hard candy to be able to show something after a grab, but he could not do this often; he was not given mu
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
h money. A quarter a week was his allowance, and he had to have a nickel on Friday and a nickel on Saturday for two movie serials he was following, and that meant he could not buy much at the five-and-ten if he wanted to have a cinnamon bun and pickle, tw
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  cents, at recess. And so he became a five-finger grabber. \tab 
He was very successful, and when he saw how successful he was he wanted to do it all the time. Most of the other fellows in the gang stole only for the sake of stealing; that explained why some o\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 them, emptying their pockets after a grab, would pull out white feet for women s stockings, baby rattles, cards of safety pins, wash cloths, soap, and other useless articles. But Julian became so proficient that he could tell beforehand what he was going
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 to get, and usually he would get it. The gang would separate on entering the store, and there would be so many boys wandering around that it was hard to keep track of them. \tab 
Julian did not know that he was being watched. He had been watched for a long tim\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, and the manager saw that Julian was not taking things and stopped watching him. But when he began to have success as a grabber the salesgirls learned to keep on the lookout for him. They knew who he was; a Lantenengo Street kid, who did not have to stea
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 . Several of them reported him to the manager, who thereafter forgot all about the other kids in order to keep his eye on Julian. \tab 
One day after school the gang decided to have a Five-Finger Grab, and they all trooped down to Kresge s. When they entered t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e store a bell rang, but they paid no attention to it; bells were always ringing in the store signals to cash girls, signals to the assistant managers and floor walkers and stock boys. Bells were always ringing. Julian had announced beforehand that he wou
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d get a flashlight for Butch, in return for which Butch was going to steal a large hunk of summer sausage from the Doerflinger meat market. Not just an ordinary slice, that he could get for the asking, but a hunk at least a foot long. \tab 
The flashlight came\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
as a case, battery, and lamp: ten cents for each part, thirty cents altogether. The electrical supplies counter was very near the front door, and Julian went right to it. The girl standing in front of the counter the clerks stood in front of counters that

were against the walls asked him what he wanted, and he said he was only waiting for a friend who had gone to another part of the store. She looked at him without saying anything and kept looking at him. Well, he was not going to let her scare him, and he
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
could outsmart her. He took out a package of Ziras, put one in his mouth, and pretended to reach in his pocket for a match, but all the cigarettes dropped to the floor, as Julian planned. The girl automatically leaned over, which was more than Julian had 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ounted on he merely wanted to distract her. He too leaned over, and as he did his right hand reached over the counter and he had the flashlight in his pocket before he began to pick up the cigarettes. No smoking in here, the girl said. \tab 
 Who said so? said\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Julian, and at that moment his arm was grabbed tight. \tab

Quickly there was a crowd around, and some of the fellows were in the crowd. They were frightened, and a couple of them left, which gave Julian a sinking feeling but he did not blame them, and he was glad to see that Butch and Carter staye

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d to work; the difficulty was in getting started. He wanted to work to put things out of his mind, and he tried to the extent of getting out some scratch paper and pencils with the idea of working out some sort of summary or recapitulation of the year s b

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 . It certainly made it hard to lose. He wondered if Harry Reilly had gone to work already. Harry was a very rich man and handling his investments and holdings was a full-time job, but he also managed to know \tab 
what was going on in other people s businesses,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 and it would be just like him to know that old Quilty was thinking of buying a Cadillac. It was just the kind of thing he would know. After all, why shouldn t he know it? He had lent Julian twenty thousand dollars last summer, and that was a nice piece o

Twenty thousand dollars! Why in God s name had he ever asked for that much? He knew perfectly well why he had \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
sked for that much: at the time he needed ten thousand, but he figured he might as well get a good hunk while he was at it. Ten thousand had gone in no time: it cost, even with the cheap labor and construction costs of last summer, about eight thousand to
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
build the inclined driveway inside the building, which he had calculated would mean eventually a great saving in electric power bills through decreased use of the elevator. So far it hadn t made much difference, if any. In fact, Julian would not have argu
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
d very long if someone suggested that the driveway was an ill-advised project. Then what else was there? Well, there were those two three-wheel motorcycles. The idea of them was a mechanic would ride the motorcycle to, say, the Davis garage, hook some kin
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 of gadget on the Davis Cadillac, and drive the car, with the motorcycle trailing along behind, back to the Gibbsville-Cadillac Motor Car Company for servicing or repairs. That was another idea that was going to make a saving, but the saving, Julian was s

re, had failed to make a showing on the books. And why two motorcycles? One was enough. More than enough. Then there were the trees, those beautiful, slender trees. Julian had conditioned himself against ever seeing them when he passed them, but now he ma
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
s not sure of the name of them. They had been purchased while he was in a fine, naturalistic mood as an aftermath of a City Beautiful luncheon. There had been trees a long time ago where the Gibbsville-Cadillac Motor Car Company now stood, and there had b
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

The other ten thousand had gone for expenses, real ones, like payments on notes, payroll,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 and so on. \tab 
Lute was right on another score: Ed Charney was a good customer. I m a good customer of Ed s, Julian reminded himself, but he s a better one of mine. Something ought to be done about Ed, but he supposed the best thing to do for the present was

drink with Harry in a party of undershirted convivials in the locker-room, and Harry was a fair tenor and even knew songs about the roll of Delta Kappa Epsilon, Lafayette was Lafayette when Lehigh was a pup, the Lord Jeff of Amherst, and a lot of other co

st summer Julian had needed money, and Harry Reilly had money, so he had asked Harry. And Harry had said: Jesus, I ain t got that much cash at this present minute. Do you need it right away? Julian had said he needed it pretty soon. Well, I don t see how 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 Gentlemen!

\par \tab \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Gentlemen! You know the club rules. It was Straight. He stood in front of Froggy, with his back toward Froggy, facing Julian. He certainly made it look\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 as though he were protecting Froggy from an attack by Julian. By this time there was no doubt about the lawyers being in on the quarrel. They were all watching, and two of them were standing up. Julian heard one of them say something about see what he di

\par \tab \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Well, that was all right. It was a slap at Julian, who had been posted two or three times, but it also was a slap at Froggy, Carter, Bobby Herrman\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 Oh, yes. Mr. Luck is a member.

\par \tab \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Hey, you! said the lawyer. \tab  Aw, said Julian, finally too tired and disgusted with himself and everyone else. He took a step backwards and got into position, and then he let the lawyer have it, full in the mouth
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 Put that down! said Froggy. \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 H\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 Come on, said Julian, to the man with the bottle. The man saw the carafe and hesita\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 Go on out and get a warrant, Stiney, called the lawyer whom Julian had socked.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 Julian hit him again, hit him in the hands, which were covering the sore mouth. He hit him again in the ear. Froggy grabbed Julian s shoulder to pull him away, and Julian pulled up his shoulder so suddenly that it hit Froggy in the chin. The lawyer went 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 Hi, boy. Someone called to him. Julian had his foot on the starter and he identified the greeter as Whit Hofman. Well, Whit\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
was a son of a bitch, too. Whit probably hated him and had hated him for years, just as Froggy had done. The car jumped out of the snow and Julian drove as fast as he could to the quickest way out of Gibbsville. The worst of that drive was that the sun gl

a Dutch farming country, when he first brought himself up. He was first able to perceive that he had been driving, judging by the distance at least a half hour, when he became aware of not having a hat on. He reached over and picked up the hat beside him,
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
but his fingers rejected the dents in the crown, and he examined the hat. The brim did not snap down in front. It was a Stetson, and Julian wore Herbert Johnson hats from Brooks Brothers. But he did not like to see men driving hatless in closed cars; it w

s too much like the Jews in New York who ride in their town cars with the dome lights lit. He put the hat on the back of his head, and lowered the window at his side. The first breath of air made him want a cigarette almost immediately, and he slowed down
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 to light one from the torch on the dashboard. \tab 
The road was his. He wanted to drive on the left side and zigzag like an army transport and idle along at four miles an hour. But one time when he thought the road was his he had done all these things, finall\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y

So long as the engin\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

Herbert Harley said he thought he heard a car about ten o clock. It sounded like a Ford, starting in front of the English home, but he could have been mistaken. Or, as Deputy Coroner Moskowitz pointed out, it could have bee\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 just any car that happened to stop in front of the English home. Dr. Moskowitz wanted to have the thing all neat and no loose ends, and he wished the driver of the car would come forth and reveal himself; but he guessed he never would; that part of town 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
as pretty secluded, you might say, and necking couples often went there. So the car probably was just some necking couple, Dr. Moskowitz said, and anyway it was an open-and-shut case of suicide by carbon monoxide gas poisoning, the first of its kind in th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 history of the county (and a damn nice, clean way of knocking yourself off, he added off the record). What happened, as he reconstructed it, was: Mr. English had had difficulties with Mrs. English, so he went home and got drunk and while temporarily dera
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ged through alcohol and grief, he, being well acquainted with the effects of carbon monoxide, being in the automobile business, why he committed suicide. There was no doubt about him being insane, at least temporarily, because from the broken Victrola rec

rds in the house, and the clock that was smashed in the car, deceased manifestly had been in a drunken rage and therefore not responsible. His widow, Caroline W. English, was apparently the last one to see him alive, and that was about four o clock in the
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 afternoon. Mrs. English had telephoned the two servants in the house and informed them that a party scheduled for that night was postponed, and they could go home and so they went. \tab 
Fortunately deceased had seen fit to vent his rage and smash the clock in\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the front part of the car, which readily enabled the deputy coroner to fix the time of death at about eleven o clock P.M., the night of December 26, year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred thirty. Thus it will be seen that seven hours elapsed between t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e last time Caroline W. English had seen her late husband and the time of his death. This was verified by Mrs. Judge Walker, mother of Caroline W. English, at whose home Mrs. English had been stopping from the time she last saw deceased up to the time she
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 had been informed of his death. \tab 
This had been done by Dr. William D. English, chief of staff, Gibbsville Hospital, and also father of deceased, the first physician called after the body was discovered. \tab The body had been discovered by Herbert G. Harley, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ext-door neighbor of deceased. Mr. Harley was an electrical engineer, employed by the Midas Washeries Company, operators of the Midas, Black Run, Horse Cave, and Sadim washeries. Mr. Harley was at home reading, the night of the death of Mr. English. Mrs. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 H\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
arley had gone to bed early, being exhausted as it was the day after Christmas and with children in the house, the day after Christmas you know how it is. Well, so Mr. Harley was reading a book called N by E, by Rockwell Kent. He happened to remember that
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
because he had met Mr. Kent once while on a visit to New York; he had met him at the Princeton Club. And that was how he happened to remember the name of the book. He was reading it, or rather to be exact studying the pictures in it, when he heard the car
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
start in Mr. English s garage. The time, he should judge, as nearly as he could place it, was roughly about ten-thirty. In the evening. Ten-thirty P.M. He thought nothing of it at the time, as he and Mr. English came and went and while they were always ve

y friendly and polite in a neighborly way, they never were what you would call good friends, as Mr. English traveled with, well, a different crowd from the one Mr. Harley traveled with. He had known Mr. English about four years and saw him on the average 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 bout once a day usually. \tab Well, so he went on reading the book and then for some reason that he }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs24\insrsid9389186 \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

n before you see the person. That was the feeling he got, and Mr. Harley wanted to be sure to make it clear that he did not believe in spiritualism or anything like that, as he had a scientific education and he did not believe in that kind of bunk. It was
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
all right for some people; they could believe what they liked. But Mr. Harley did not hold with that school of thought, and to prove it, he had an explanation, what might be called a scientific explanation, of why he had that feeling. The explanation was 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 his: he had been sitting there perhaps a half an hour, and something inside him told him something was wrong. In a minute he understood what it was; it was the motor running. \tab 
All that time the motor had been running in Mr. English s car. You could feel t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e low vibration of it, hear the distant sound of it. Not loud, the sounds weren t; and the vibrations weren t strong. But out where they had their home you get so you know every little sound, and it was very unusual for a motor to be running that length o
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 time. Mr. Harley debated with himself and finally decided to go take a look and see what was what. He thought perhaps Mr. English was having trouble with his car, and he was going to volunteer his assistance. \tab 
Well, the moment he stepped out on his front\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
porch he knew there was something amiss. The motor was running, but the garage was dark. He got closer to the garage and he looked in a window the one in the west wall of the garage and all he could see was the car. The dash lights were the only lights in
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the whole garage that were burning. He thought it best to go tell Mr. English that he had left his motor running and to warn him against staying in the garage any length of time. Mr. Harley of course knew the danger of carbon monoxide and had known one or
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning in his engineering experience. He went up and rang the bell of the English home, then he opened the door and called out, but there was no answer from anyone. Then he ran as fast as he could back to the garage. He ope
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ed the big door and the windows so as to create a draft, and then he opened the front door of the car, and there was Mr. English. \tab 
He was lying sort of slumped down on the seat, half of his body almost off the seat. Mr. Harley had a little trouble, as Mr.\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
English was not a small man, but finally he got him and carried him, fireman-fashion, out of the garage and laid him down on the driveway. He felt Mr. English s heart and there were no beats, and he felt his pulse, and there was no pulse. He tried giving 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
im artificial respiration, because he knew the value of artificial respiration in such cases, and he yelled as loud as he could to his wife, and when Mrs. Harley stuck her head out the bedroom window he told her to call Dr. English. \tab 
He continued giving a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
tificial respiration until Dr. English came, but Dr. English examined his son and pronounced him dead. They carried the body inside the house and then Dr. English thanked Mr. Harley and Mr. Harley went back to quiet Mrs. Harley, who by that time was almos
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  out of her wits, with not knowing what it was all about. \tab 
As nearly as Mr. Harley recalled, Mr. English was attired in dark gray trousers, white shirt without a tie, black shoes. There was a strong odor of whiskey about his person. His eyes were open and\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
his face was pinkish, or, rather, pallid with a pinkish tinge. Mr. Harley asked permission to add that in his opinion, judging by the position of the body and what he knew about such cases, Mr. English may have wanted to commit suicide when he first got i
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  the car, but that he had changed his mind just before becoming unconscious, but had not had the strength to get out of the car. \tab 
Well, that did not alter the main fact, in the opinion of Dr. Moskowitz. All they had to go on proved pretty conclusively tha\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 deceased had taken his own life, no matter what else might have been in his mind. The jury returned a verdict to that effect. \tab 
Dr. English thought it best not to try to influence the verdict of the jury. In this case let the little kike quack Moskowitz h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
wer when From the Terrace was published in 1958, and I think I ve gained the wisdom needed to handle a really big novel about a big subject. In the past, critics of my work have started with Appointment in Samarra and worked forward. Now, I think they ll 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
tart with From the Terrace and look back. This belief, if mistaken, is surely very natural, and readers are bound to sympathize with it, though O Hara does sometimes seem almost as sensitive as Hemingway was about criticism of his latest work, as if he we
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
e not so confident as he appears. O Hara once stopped writing short stories for The New Yorker which he does brilliantly because the magazine published an unfavorable review of one of his novels; he is supposed to have told the editor that unless The New 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 Y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 orker got rid of that reviewer it would get no more O Hara short stories, and he was as good as his word for several years. \tab 
Twenty years ago, Edmund Wilson defined the kind of excellence that makes Appointment in Samarra the fine book it is: O Hara, he s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
id, is ... a social commentator; and in this field of social habit and manners ... he has done work that is original and interesting. & His grasp of what lies underneath it is not, however, so sure. We need to see what this distinction really means if we 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
re to do full justice to Appointment in Samarra. If we concentrate on the story of Julian English, on his inner life and the inner lives of the other characters, we are likely to find the novel merely competent. These elements in the book are handled inte
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 ligently enough for its purpose, but that purpose is something else, and if we do not see what it is, we are likely to miss the book s real achievement. \tab 
 What, as Mr. Wilson asks, is the relevance to the story ... of the newspaper woman (pp. 38-39) ... w\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

seem to warrant this full-length introduction. That is certainly true if we insist that the real subject of Appointment in Samarr\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
a is the drama of Julian English s life and death. But if we insist on that, then the whole story of Al Grecco, of which the account of this newspaperwoman is a part, is equally irrelevant, though it occupies nearly a fifth of the novel and has an indepen

ent narrative life of its own. By this standard, too, the flashback about Caroline English s growing up is much longer than it needs to be; the story of Irma and Luther Fliegler, with which the novel begins and ends, is only superficially relevant; and th
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  book s conclusion especially its wonderful glimpse of Caroline English s old beau, Ross Campbell, and Julian s Polish girl, Mary is anticlimactic. \tab

of Gibbsville. All the characters, even Julian English, are here not for their own sakes, but because they represent significant social elements in Gibbsville; and Gibbsville is here because it is a microcosm of American life as it was actually lived at t

n. If Al Grecco and Ed Charney are irrelevant to the drama of Julian English, they are an important part of the drama of Gibbsville, and so is Lydia Faunce Browne, the newspaperwoman, who seems to Mr. Wilson a mistake. \tab

life of Irma and Lute Fliegler shows us how the respectable domesticity of what we would call if we admitted we have classes the middle class contrasts with the upper-class life of the Englishes. The Flieglers live on Lantenengo Street, and Irma feels the

One might say that O Hara comes by his knowledge of Gibbsville naturally, except that if knowledge like this did not take a rare talent, everyone born in Pottsvi\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
le, Pennsylvania, around 1905, as John O Hara was, would have it. O Hara was the eldest of eight children born to a doctor a good deal like the Dr. Malloy who appears briefly in Appointment in Samarra and at greater length elsewhere in O Hara for instance
,\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 in the fine short story called The Doctor s Son, where Dr. Malloy s son, Jim, also appears, as he does as a writer around New York in Butterfield 8 and as the Hollywood scriptwriter and narrator of Hope of Heaven. Just as John O Hara, after getting fired

from two prep schools, was graduated from Niagara Prep and had passed his entrance examinations for Yale, Dr. O Hara died, and there was no money to send John to Yale. It is hard to avoid feeling that this disappointment helped to fix in O Hara a combinat

on of envy and dislike of the people who did become Yale or Princeton or even Lafayette gentlemen ( Merry Christmas, you stuck-up bastards! as Al Grecco says to Lantenengo Street) that seems to be the driving force behind his insatiable curiosity about th

 life of the American upper classes. There are few people who know this country better than I do, O Hara characteristically remarked not long ago. I know every important person in this country, or I know someone close to each of them. O Hara would probabl

 be eager to offer you evidence if you challenged this fantastic claim, but it would be evidence of what drives him rather than evidence of what makes him a good writer, even if it were true. It is not O Hara s merely factual knowledge but his imaginative
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 grasp of American life that makes Appointment in Samarra a remarkable book. \tab 
This marvelous imaginative grasp of what it feels like for each social group to live in Gibbsville is the real subject of the book; the story of Julian English merely provides th\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 plot. The long flashbacks about Al Grecco and Caroline English, the concluding account of Gibbsville s various class reactions to Julian s death, and all the other details not related in any significant way to Julian s life itself represent significant p
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
rts of Gibbsville s life. Moreover, to describe all this as social comment is not nearly good enough; it does not begin to suggest the quality of O Hara s insight or the sharpness of his observation. \tab 
It may be that we do not know the personal motives of \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ny of the characters do not, as Mr. Wilson says, really know why Julian English committed suicide and that O Hara s grasp of these aspects of life is not very sure. He does seem to depend for his explanation of the inner lives of his characters on some un
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 nalyzed assumptions about men s natures, some habits, \tab 
perhaps, of his own consciousness. Excessive melancholy and sensitivity, especially self-pity, combined with an extreme nastiness of manner, regularly characterize his heroes and more than once drive \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
hem to suicide. As Mr. Wilson says, heel for heel, Pal Joey is a comedown after Julian English, and though Julian sometimes knows he is a son of a bitch-at one point he says he is-it is uncertain that either he or O Hara knows he is a first-class heel. 
\tab T\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ere is some evidence, in fact, that Julian is meant to be the true American gentleman, refined, aware, instinctively gallant, whose bad behavior is a result of his sensitive nature s being driven beyond restraint by the crudeness of the people around him.
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
On the rare occasions when we are told about his deepest feelings, he is very sensitive; when he remembered the morning after that he had thrown a drink in Harry Reilly s face, for instance, the knowledge returned to him ... as though in a terrible, vibra
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ing sound; like standing too near a big bell and having it suddenly struck without warning. We are told very early that Ed Charney, a shrewd judge of people, thinks highly of Julian ( That English, he s my boy. For my money I will take that English. He s 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 right guy. ), and we are regularly informed of Julian s charm, his grace as a dancer, his skill with women. He has all O Hara s passionate respect for the expensive appurtenances of life ( It s like playing golf with cheap clubs, or playing tennis with a
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
dollar racket, or bad food. It s like anything cheap, he says). For Caroline, Julian had that gallantry that ... was attitude and manner; a gesture with a cigarette in his hand, his whistling, his humming while he played solitaire. & In the strict privacy
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 of the country club s porch, he and Monsignor Creedon exchange what seem to be intended as the opinions of men civilized beyond the understanding of anyone else in Gibbsville. \tab 
But what we are to think of the other aspect of Julian s character, it is diff\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
cult to say. He treats Caroline without consideration for her feelings, humiliates her publicly, and speaks to her in an unforgivable way because he is so intent on expressing his own hurt feelings that be never thinks of what she is feeling. Having done 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
o, be insists that Caroline is behaving unforgivably if she fails him in the slightest way. Blind, without knowing, you could stick by me, he says to her. That s what you d do if you were a real wife, but, what the hell. He is filled with egotism and self
-\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
pity in a way he seems only rarely to suspect. The question is whether the reader is intended to see all this as forgivable (like the bad manners Hamlet displays in his antic moments) because Julian is sensitive in a superior way, or whether he is to find
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 them unforgivable and think that Julian, heel for heel, leaves Pal Joey nowhere. The very fact that Mr. Wilson found Julian a \tab 
heel on a heroic scale and that other critics have thought him a modern Hamlet suggests the novel s lack of clarity about the in\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ermost lives of its characters. But no novelist can do everything, and the inner lives of the characters are not the main interest of Appointment in Samarra. \tab 
What O Hara does see with marvelous exactness are the social motives of his characters; he knows\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
exactly how they think and feel as members of their class and group. He knows what a man like Julian English carries in his pocket, what phonograph records he owns, what kind of car he drives, and how he drives it; he knows exactly how Frannie Snyder and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
l Grecco can meet and how they will act together; he knows exactly how women first broke the taboo against their coming into the smoking room of the Lantenengo Country Club, who sits at what table there and why, what can be done and what not done when the
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 do. Moreover, he knows these things not simply as facts but as experience. It was about two o clock, U. S. Naval Observatory Hourly By Western Union time, when Al Grecco appeared in the doorway of the Apollo Restaurant, and we can see, as Al has for year
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, that standard clock, inscribed with its typical American mixture of scientific boasting and advertising, that hung in the Apollo Restaurant as it hung in tens of thousands of public places all over America. \tab 
In addition, we see these things through the \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
yes of characters we know well, through the eyes of Al Grecco, who loves Ed Charney and is as loyal to him and his organization as men are to well-loved families; through the eyes of Irma Fliegler, who nearly cries when she recognizes the courage of Lute 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
 joking about Alfred P. Sloan when he is worried that he will lose his job after Julian s death; through the eyes of Harry Reilly, whose sister calls him anxiously in New York after Julian s death but remembers to ask him to buy Monsignor Creedon a new bi
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
etta. We know all these people well enough as social beings to follow what they are feeling and to experience with them what they experience. So we listen with Irma Fliegler to the clacking of a broken chain link in the quiet dawn of Christmas morning, or
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
time with Al Grecco the familiar run from the Apollo to the Stage Coach Inn, or listen with Julian English to Paul Whiteman playing I ll Build a Stairway to Paradise on the Victrola. Through Julian s eyes we watch scornfully the lower class manners of Har
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
y Reilly as he tells a story in the smoking room of the Lantenengo Country Club, or listen with Lute Fliegler to Pat Quilty, the Irish undertaker, refusing to buy a Cadillac, out of Catholic solidarity with Harry Reilly, whom Julian has insulted. Knowing 
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 he class and group feelings of all these characters, we can see and hear them behind the way Lute Fiegler talks to \tab 
Julian English, or Caroline talks to her father-in-law, or Helene Holman to a drunken Julian, or even Al Grecco s way of speaking to Mrs. G\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
ady, the Englishes cook. All these insights are pointed up for us by a story that is as tightly constructed as a well-made play. \tab 
Appointment in Samarra even observes in its own way the unities of time and place and action. The story takes about three day\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
, beginning slightly after midnight of Christmas Eve and ending about the same time two days later (the clock in Julian s Cadillac reads 10:41 when he smashes it with the whiskey bottle as he waits for the carbon monoxide to kill him). Except in the flash
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
acks, and seldom then, we never leave the environs of Gibbsville; and the stories of the various social groups in the novel are carefully connected to make the single story of Gibbsville. All this neatness would be ineffective, of course, if O Hara had no
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  made the people and events of his story vividly true, as he has. \tab 
The climax of the novel occurs Christmas night at the Stage Coach Inn; the scene is a virtuoso performance. At one table sits Helene Holman, aching to make an evening of it and as a conseq\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

 No worse than a bad cold, Vic, said Lute. What was that strange noise I heard? he held his ear in the direction of Irma. \tab Onto this scene erupt \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

even contemplated bringing homemade gin to the party, but compromised on rye in two \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 int bottles so that the guests, seeing only one pint to begin with, would not drink the Flieglers liquor.) 
\tab  What of it? says Julian. Is it any my business who has rye or who has Scotch? Well. I think I have to leave you now, my friends. & I see little ol\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
defied, and Julian s friends have been disgusted. These are the consequences of Julian s vengeance on Caroline, and perhaps in some unconscious way he sought them too. In any event, he can never resist the impulse to strike out when he imagines people do

ot love him as he wants them to; later on, he beats up Froggy Ogden, who lost an arm in the war, because Froggy says he has always disliked Julian. As they drove home from the Stage Coach, Julian felt the tremendous excitement, the great thrilling lump in
\hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af31505\loch\f0 
the chest and abdomen that comes before the administering of an unknown, well-deserved punishment. This is perhaps as near as we come to a real motive for his suicide. That afternoon at the office he had tried sticking a revolver in his mouth; this rehear
